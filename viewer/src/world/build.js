// The geometry of a floor for the 3D world, built from the package: in the
// browser (world.js) or ahead of time in Node (viewer/world/bake.mjs, which writes
// it as binary glTF for a package's world/ folder). No DOM here: three.js's maths
// and geometry only, so both build the same floor.
//
// A floor comes out as a few merged pieces, one per material and use (the walls'
// faces, the floor finishes of offices, the door leaves, …), so a floor of 800
// rooms is drawn in a few dozen draw calls. The floor finishes and the x-ray
// volumes carry their room's index (`_room`; `rooms` lists the IDs), to pick a room
// by its triangles; the walls' faces carry the room each faces (`_room`, past the end of
// `rooms` for a face outside every room), so that each side of a wall is finished as its
// room is (the world draws a piece's triangles a finish at a time: groupByFinish). Boxes
// (door frames, skirting, …) and furniture are written
// straight into arrays, the furniture from one template a kind and size: a floor of
// a thousand rooms and desks is built in tens of milliseconds.
//
// What every look draws is here: skirting along the walls, architraves and lever
// handles on doors, window boards, ceiling panels (ceilingPanels: where the walker's
// lights are), furniture with its chairs; and, asked for (`edges`, the "model"
// look), the lines along their edges. How they are drawn is materials.js's.
//
// Local metres: x east, y up, z south, from the building's origin (originOf). A
// plan point is [x, n] (n north, so z = −n).
